# CUDA-Raytracer-Optimized
A simple ray tracer written with CUDA that saves its output in a .ppm file, This is an attempt to optimize the code from the following repo: https://github.com/xkevio/CUDA-Raytracer

## How to run
To compile the code simply use ```make run```.

Then run ```./gpu.out```.

This will generate an image called ```img.ppm```.

NOTE: if 8192x8192 pixels are used the image will be around 670 MBs.
